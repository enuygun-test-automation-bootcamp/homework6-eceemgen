# homework6
-In one of these two assignments, the task of rewriting the code was done by replacing the "for" loops in the codes with "stream".

-As in last week's assignment, development was done based on the main project.

-In the other project, homework codes were developed in the codes we wrote about the Flocake site by going over the main project done in the course, just like last week.

-Different scenarios related to Flocake were tried to be written.
